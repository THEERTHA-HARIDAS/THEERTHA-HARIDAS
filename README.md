# 👋 Hi, I'm Theertha Haridas

I'm a Civil Engineering graduate currently transitioning into the field of Data Science. My background in engineering has given me a strong analytical foundation, and in recent years, I’ve upskilled through a data science certification and completed hands-on projects in machine learning, data analysis, and visualization.

I enjoy working with structured and unstructured data, building predictive models, and turning insights into actions. My goal is to apply data science to solve real-world problems in a meaningful way.
